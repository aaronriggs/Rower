Rower: An open source, collaborative project that will allow a Concept2 rowing machine user to analyze their workout data visually, and compare workouts to discover new insights.

Over the course of this project's development, I/we will add new functionality to the application that will help each individual user not only visualize their workout data, but help them discover trends that will ultimately lead to more consistent workouts and overall better health. 

Eventually, this project will also be pulled into a much larger project that encompasses all of Concept2's product line, for one overall workout analyzer. 

I look forward to collaborating with anyone willing to devote their time to this project!
